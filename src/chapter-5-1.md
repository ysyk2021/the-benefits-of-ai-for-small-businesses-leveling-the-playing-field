AI systems can analyze large volumes of financial data in real-time, allowing for efficient fraud detection and prevention. Small businesses can leverage AI algorithms to identify suspicious transactions, patterns of fraudulent activities, and anomalies. This proactive approach to fraud mitigation helps protect the financial interests of small businesses and enhances security.

4. **Cash Flow Forecasting**
